## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Recreate
1. **Dataset Preparation**: Upload CSV data and `manifest.json` to an S3 bucket.
2. **QuickSight Account Setup**: Enable access to S3 for QuickSight.
3. **Data Connection**: Link the S3 bucket to QuickSight using the `manifest.json`.
4. **Visualization**: Create various graphs and apply filters for in-depth analysis.
5. **Dashboard Publishing**: Generate and publish an insightful dashboard.

 **The manifest.json file provides instructions to Amazon QuickSight on how to locate and interpret the dataset stored in the S3 bucket. It includes details such as the bucket URL and file format for seamless data integration. I have uploaded a sample of how manifest.json looks like under the file name manifest.template.json.
