# AWS-Data-visualization-with-Quicksight

Amazon QuickSight helps to analyse data and create visualisations easily. Using Quicksight I have analysed a huge dataset of Netflix shows and movies to create a dashboard that extracts various insights.

# Steps involved:
Upload a dataset into an S3 bucket.

🆕 Create an account on Amazon QuickSight.

🔗 Connect your dataset (in the S3 bucket) to Amazon QuickSight.

📊 Create a variety of graphs, charts and analysis using QuickSight.

🏆 Publish a dashboard full of insights into your dataset!
